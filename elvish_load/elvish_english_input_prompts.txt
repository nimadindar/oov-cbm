This file has some data on which we can evaluate our methodology. 
Metrics: 

1. Similarity between image generated for elvish text (without adaptive layer), english text and elvish text (after adaptive layer). 
  a. Quantitively: using image comparison measures
  b. Qualitatively: By asking users how much they would rate each picture on a Likert scale of 1-5 

2. Interpretability: We can print the concepts that are activated before we generate the prompt to stable diffusion. The concepts activated tell us what is guiding the diffusion process.
